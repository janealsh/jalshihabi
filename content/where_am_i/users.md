<h1>Identifying the Users</h1>
<br/>

In addition to the general public, we had two more specific user groups in mind:

1. <b>Educators</b>: in recent years, there has been a stronger focus on the education of indigenous history in Canadian schools. Because the information in this application is heavily condensed and easily navigatable, educators can assign its use to students for assignments or a lesson. There could also be a website version we can design in the future to make it more accessible in classrooms.
2. <b>Students</b>: by extension, students who are old enough to study indigenous history should also be able to use this app smoothly. We accomodated by making the UI relatively simple; no confusing buttons, clear user flows. Additionally, the information in the home page accessible in a scroll-like fashion, similarly to how social media is browsed, which is common among young users.

As mentioned, we also considered the general public in our design since it is not merely the two above groups who should use it. It should be engaging enough to hook users in and should be easy to use for any age group. We planned to acommodate for this by making the information on the application concise and paired with visuals for engagement, and keeping app navigation simple for ease of use.
