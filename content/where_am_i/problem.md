<h1>Defining the Problem</h1>
<br/>

People in Canada, or rather on Turtle Island, are often aware that there were indigenous people living there before the European colonizers arrived. What is not frequently mentioned is that we are ourselves settlers on indigenous land, and we find that the injustices they faced are often discussed more widely than the vibrancy of their culture. <i>We deserve to know more about indigenous people, and they deserve to be known more thoroughly and accurately.</i>

While there is information online that does show maps according the indigenous territories, we had yet to find a platform that combines it with cultural information and current events. These resources are also usually on a website rather than a mobile app, and are not as full of information nor as easy to navigate as we'd have liked.

In summary:

<div class="important-text">
    How do we inform the general public of indigenous peoples' history while also presenting its beauty? And how can this be accomplished in a way that is informative, engaging, and user-friendly?
