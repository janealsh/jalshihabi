<h1>Identifying Use Cases</h1>
<br/>

Maple Learn has mostly been used by educators, and the product management team at Maplesoft had strong links to some of the customers. After many discussions and meetings with these stakeholders and some brainstorming on our part, we thought of 3 primary use cases to keep in mind when designing the collaboration feature.

  1. A grade 10 pre-calculus teacher assigning Maple Learn documents as homework
  2. Students working on a group project within a Maple Learn document
  3. A virtual tutoring session within a Maple Learn document
