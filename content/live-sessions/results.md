<h1>The Results</h1>
<br/>

In the end, our customers were very pleased with the quick release of a V1 feature that suited their needs! Live sessions is also a paid feature, so it is also now a factor of motivation for users to purchase the paid version of Maple Learn, both for individuals and educators.

Of course, after discussions with the CEO, Senior Product Manager, developers, and UX/UI designer, the above concepts evolved to become what is now the production version of Live Sessions in <a href="https://learn.maplesoft.com/"> Maple Learn</a>.
