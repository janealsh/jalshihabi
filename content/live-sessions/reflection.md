<h1>Reflection and Learning</h1>
<br/>

This was my first application of UX/UI and Figma in a professional setting, and I believe it was an essential step in developing my design skills.
<br/> 
<br/>

<h5>What I learned</h5>

During this project, I refreshed my Figma knowledge while also making sure I was using good Figma practice to keep design files organized. I also learned how important it is to communicate with all other team members such as the developers in order to ensure the design specifications. 

<br/>

<h5>What I would do next time</h5>

Next time, I would start with a wireframe rather than going straight into the prototype. I did apply this lesson learned in my future mockups within my same co-op term at Maplesoft, but I would have liked to look more deeply into how wireframes are converted into Figma prototypes in professional settings.
<br/>
<br/>

To conclude, my experience during this co-op term was packed with many learning experiences that allowed me to broaden my view of how the design process occurs for new features, all the way from the initial ideas to the final product. The live session feature was my first UX/UI-related project during the term, so it is slightly rougher than the subsequent projects, and seeing my progress throughout the term was fascinating. In the future, I'd love to explore this process in a more design-focused setting, such as in a formal UX/UI co-op position, where there are more tools, resources, and mentors specialized in this knowledge available.

**I have many other mockups from my co-op at Maplesoft which I cannot present on my website due to confidentiality reasons. However, I'd be more than happy to show them in person or over a call!** 

My contact information is on my resume, which can be downloaded on the Resum√© tab of this website.
